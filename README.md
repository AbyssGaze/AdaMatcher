> Since our code open source requires review and related patent support, we need to complete the application for the relevant process, and it is expected that the open source will be completed around April 1.


## Installation
For environment and data setup, please refer to [LoFTR](https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR).


## Run AdaMatcher

### Download Pretrained model
We have provide pretrained model in megadepth dataset, you can download it from [weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1067_GfX7i_ZLj6Sp68S3d9cofdaPlDZW?usp=share_link).

### Download Datasets
You need to setup the testing subsets of ScanNet, MegaDepth and YFCC first from [driven](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TE_zJlKfPFRLeIrtq5iMBBjg-XaovNon).

For the data utilized for training, we use the same training data as [LoFTR](https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR) does.


### Megadepth validation
For different scales, you need edit ![megadepth_test_scale_1000](configs/data/megadepth_test_scale_1000.py).

```shell
# with shell script
bash ./scripts/reproduce_test/outdoor_ada_scale.sh
```


### Reproduce the testing results for yfcc datasets
```shell
# with shell script
bash ./scripts/reproduce_test/yfcc100m.sh
```

<br/>


## Training
We train AdaMatcher on the MegaDepth datasets following [LoFTR](https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR/blob/master/docs/TRAINING.md). And the results can be reproduced when training with 32gpus. Please run the following commands:

```
sh scripts/reproduce_train/outdoor_ada.sh
```
